- move all global symbols into the "tex" namespace, so that
  we can use the std C++ library without name clashes.

- rewrite the error handling, put in exceptions for fatal
  ones.

- turn the "tex" namespace into a class, so that only a 
  pointer to this class remains global.

- group functions into classes and give them the global
  tex pointer as an argument.
