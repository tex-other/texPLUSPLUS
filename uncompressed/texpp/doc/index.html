<h3>Why a new TeX implementation?</h3> 
<blockquote>
The current de-facto standard implementation of TeX for Unix,
namely the one based on <a href="http://www.tug.org/web2c/">Web2c</a>, 
has a number of shortcomings:
<ul>
<li>It is written in Pascal (dressed up in Web) which is a language
that not many modern programmers are familiar with. Extensions to TeX
are therefore very, very hard to get implemented. Moreover, because of
this intermediate Pascal to C translation layer, the size of the
sources is extremely big (despite the fact that the resulting
"<code>tex</code>" binary may be small). It is also a pain to install from
sources (with TeX++ it's a matter of <code>./configure</code>,
<code>make</code>, <code>make install</code> together with some
<a href="#paths">trivial settings</a> to make it pick up the fonts and
style files).
<li>It still uses many ancient ideas from the original 1982
implementation of TeX (excessive emphasis on reduction of memory usage, for
instance). A lot of things can be done much more cleanly when present-day
computing power is taken into account. 
<li>It uses the (in my opinion) ridiculous path searching
mechanism of kpathsea, which is enormously bloated simply because it
tries to be backwards compatible with every single TeX installation
in existence. There are much cleaner and simpler solutions for pathname
resolution.
<li>It does in general not conform to the Unix "filter" philosophy, in
which input comes from stdin, output goes to stdout and diagnostic
messages go to stderr.
</ul>
TeX++ solves all of these issues, while at the same time staying as
close as possible to the original TeX.
Moreover, it has a number of interesting <a href="#new">new
features</a> which make it possible to use TeX as a typesetting engine
for a web browser. More on this at some later stage.
<p>
Why not implement a TeX-like program in a completely modern object
oriented fashion, from scratch (like <a
href="http://nts.tug.org">NTS</a> for instance, or <a
href="http://www-mgi.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~blume/Download.html">ant</a>)?
The reason is simply that there is no point throwing away things that
work. Moreover, there are zillions of documents out there written in
TeX, using the macro facilities of TeX in such a way that they will
never translate properly into a subset of the language. It is
therefore very hard to write a program that is not TeX yet processes
all existing .tex files properly.  CommonTeX is an excellent
implementation which is easy to maintain, and more importantly, it is
completely functional <strong>now</strong>. A slow conversion to more
and more "modern" programming styles is anticipated.
<p>
See also <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">Never
rewrite code from scratch</a> (which I certainly do not agree with in
general, but applies beautifully to this particular project).
<p>
I chose CommonTeX as the starting point for TeX++ because it was
written from scratch in C, rather than being converted from the
Pascal sources by an automatic converter (see <a
href="http://www.math.uni.wroc.pl/~hebisch/">TeX in C</a> for an
example of a TeX version in C which was based on an automatic
conversion from the Pascal original). The automatically generated
C sources are typically horrible to read, let alone extend. 
</blockquote>
<p><br><p>

<a name="status"><h3>Status</h3></a>
<blockquote>
This is work in progress, but the full functionality of CommonTeX is
already present (thanks to the excellent work of Pat Monardo 10 years ago). 
I have tested both plain TeX and LaTeX input files, the latter also
with use of add-on packages like amsLaTeX. In order to preload
plain.tex or latex.ltx, use the options <code>--plain</code>
or <code>--latex</code> (you need the plain tex or latex input files
for this to work; note that TeX++ currently does not use format
files, but on modern machines reading and processing of 
plain.tex or latex.ltx typically takes only a small fraction of a second).
<p>
Current work focuses on getting the TeX++ specific features in place
(margin settings and other page geometry) and cleaning up the I/O as 
well as the error messages and warnings. More information on recent 
progress can be found in the <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>.

<p><br><p>

<a name="download"><h3>Download and install</h3></a>
<blockquote>
You need the following additional software in order to compile
and use TeX++:
<ul>
<li>A decent C++ compiler; gcc 3.x and higher will do.
<font color="red">If you encounter compilation errors, mail me.</font></li>
</ul>
<p>
Then download and install <a href="texpp.tar.gz">texpp.tar.gz</a>
(SIZE Kb).
<p>
The current version is <strong>VERSION</strong> dated
<strong>DATE</strong>. The usual GNU installation instructions apply.
See the file <code>COPYING</code> for license information (it's
essentially the license of CommonTeX).
<p>
After installation, you should be able to go to the <code>tests</code>
directory and run
<center><pre>texpp --plain < tst.tex > out.dvi</pre></center>
Run the program with the <code>--help</code> flag for a list of the
options.

<a name="new"><h3>New features</h3></a>
<blockquote>
TeX++ has the following new features (compared to Knuth's original TeX):
<dl>
<dt><strong>Command-line settings for page geometry</strong></dt>
<dd>I intend to use TeX++ as an engine for a TeX document viewer. This
should typeset based on the viewer window, not on the geometry
settings in the input file. TeX++ can be driven as
<center><pre>texpp --hsize=20cm --vsize=25cm</pre></center>
to produce pages which have been typeset to the requested size.</dd>
<dt><strong>Standard Unix behaviour for input/output</strong></dt>
<dd>TeX++ reads input from stdin, writes dvi output to stdout, and
diagnostic messages to stderr. There is no .log file anymore,
but instead an option <code>--verbose</code>, which makes the
diagnostics on stderr more verbose. Unless your TeX file
does <code>\open</code> calls, TeX++ does not produce any
files, just output to stdout and stderr.</dd>
<dt><strong>Removal of old-fashioned terminal i/o</strong></dt>
<dd>TeX has a whole bunch of routines that allow you to edit the
input file while running the program, modify it, and do other
types of interactive manipulation. This has been cut out completely,
making its behaviour more robust (if there is an error, TeX++ program
will print a message on stderr, then exit with an error code).</dd>
<dt><strong>Complexity reduction</strong></dt>
<dd>Good Unix programs are nice single binaries that you can install
anywhere and configure with a couple of environment variables. 
</dl>
<p>
Other anticipated features, to be added in the near future:
<dl>
<dt><strong>Checkpointing</strong></dt>
<dd>The idea of "format files", which simply represent the internal
memory of TeX after loading (many) macros, is very useful, but was
implemented in a rather old-fashioned way in the original TeX.
With TeX++ you can dump the state of memory at any time in a 
readable format using the <code>\dump</code> command. Such dump
files can be read with <code>\restore</code>.
</dl>
<p>
The binary of TeX++ is a bit under 200Kb in size, linked to the
 standard C and C++ libraries, and that's it: no
zillions of supporting programs and libraries, 
no huge directory trees with zillions
of configuration files, but just a single nice Unix binary that you
can install anywhere you like.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p><br><p>

<a name="errors"><h3>Error/warning messages</h3></a>
<blockquote>
Error and warning messages have been cleaned up and are presented in a more
structured way:
<blockquote><pre>file.tex:345-387:Overfull hbox (4.5pt too wide)
another.tex:843:
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><br><p>

<a name="options"><h3>Options</h3></a>
<blockquote>
The following startup options are available:
<center><table>
<tr><td>--help</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>--hsize</td><td>set the initial value of the \hsize dimen</td></tr>
<tr><td>--vsize</td><td>set the initial value of the \vsize dimen</td></tr>
<tr><td>--hoffset</td><td>set the value of \hoffset</td></tr>
<tr><td>--voffset</td><td>set the value of \voffset</td></tr>
<tr><td>--margin</td><td>different way to set the margin size</td></tr>
<tr><td>--verbose</td></tr>
<tr><td>--debug</td></tr>
<tr><td>--version</td></tr>
</table></center>
If you want a mode as compatible with Knuth's original TeX as
possible, use the option <code>--verbose</code> (the 
<code>--compatible</code> option is now switched on by default and
switches off automatically when you add margin options). Output,
however, still goes to stdout instead of a .dvi file, and logging
information goes to stderr instead of the .log file.
</blockquote>
<p><br><p>

<a name="paths"><h3>Path settings</h3></a>
<blockquote>
TeX++ uses the simple though effective Unix philosophy: everything
that belongs together should sit in the same directory. Therefore,
path settings for TeX++ are extremely simple: use the environment
variables
<ul>
<li><strong>TEXPP_TFM</strong>: location of .tfm files.
<li><strong>TEXPP_STY</strong>: location of .sty and other input files.
</ul>
These variables contain ':' separated lists of paths.  Typically,
you would have one system-wide <code>/usr/lib/tex/tfm</code>
and one <code>/usr/lib/tex/sty</code> as well as per-user directories
for these sitting in users' home directories.
<p>
If you don't like "everything in one spot" idea, you should not
be tempted to re-invent kpathsea. Instead, take a look 
at <a
href="http://www.gormand.com.au/peters/tools/graft/graft.html">Graft</a>
for the right solution to the separation of packages in their own
directories (hint: soft links are your friend). 
If you have a performance problem without kpathsea, then
you probably should be thinking about dropping NFS in favour of 
more intelligent networked filesystems.
