- Turn the (done) items below into documentation.

- Add command \push to put the entire state in memory,
and a command \pop to get it back. Or something like that. Then you can
do

   \documentclass{article}
   \usepackage{amsmath}
   \push
   \begin{document}

    ....
   \end{document}
   \pop\push
   \begin{document}

    ....
   \end{document}

It is not clear whether this is really worth it though; speed seems to be fine.
(0.6 seconds for a 26 page paper in harvmac which in turn uses plain, 0.3 seconds
for a 9 page paper).

   
- How do we handle input from the terminal, like harvac's annoying
'big or little?'?

- (done) plain's \magnification is a problem, because it resets the
hsize and vsize. So we cannot just capture the first setting, we have
to capture subsequent ones too. The logic should be that we only allow
modifications of hsize/vsize _after_ the first box has been created.

- Need some logic to allow for arbitrarily long pages (to view entire
document in one browser window). Related: need something for placement
of footnotes in this case).

- Remove NONSTOPMODE, the various output modes (TERM, LOG and so on)
  and cleanup terminal input handling.
