	* Removed '#define round' from tex.h to fix compilation error with
	gcc 3.1 and higher (thanks to D.Cooke).

2002-04-18  Kasper Peeters  <K.Peeters@damtp.cam.ac.uk>

	* First step in cleanup of errors, warnings and progress
	information (a lot more to do).

	* More #defines removed. Many global symbols moved into the "tex"
	namespace to avoid clashes with the standard C++ library.

2002-04-12  Kasper Peeters  <Kasper.Peeters@cern.ch>

	* No more need for '\input plain.tex' or '\input latex.ltx'; using
	the flags --plain or --latex these files will be read
	automatically at startup.

2002-04-08  Kasper Peeters  <Kasper.Peeters@cern.ch>

	* A lot of terminal I/O removed, cleaner startup code, all
	compiler warnings removed, several '#define's removed, started
	putting things in namespaces.

2002-04-05  Kasper Peeters  <Kasper.Peeters@cern.ch>

	* A lot of superfluous error handling code removed, file I/O
	cleaned up.

2002-03-29  Kasper Peeters  <K.Peeters@damtp.cam.ac.uk>

	* Page geometry enforcement in place. Still needs to be set by
	command line arguments.

2002-03-28  Kasper Peeters  <K.Peeters@damtp.cam.ac.uk>

	* Passes the simple tst.tex and tst_latex.tex tests (loading plain
	and latex directly, not from a format file).

	* First version to compile with g++ 3.x (that is, the C++
	compiler).
